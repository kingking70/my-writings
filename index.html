            <h1>hi there</h1>
            <p>i write here when i can and want. i also conduct research here sometimes, which can be filled with cancellations and mistakes. i'm experimenting and exploring life through my writings.</p>
            <p>i write shit-ly and wisely. it all depends on the reader.</p>
            <p>if you dislike my writings, don't let me know. if you disagree with my thoughts, email me your perspective at kingston.kdk@gmail.com i'll be happy to exchange and explore yours. the world can only be shared if people could agree on having different views. </p>
            <p>if you like my writings or agree with my thoughts, just let me know in person if you get the unfortunate chance to be in the same space as me haha.</p>
