            <p>i'll occassionally update this page. the following page contents will be erased and updated as time goes by.</p>

            <h2>how am i</h2>
            <p>for the past 3-4 weeks, i think i've fallen into slight depression. it began with consuming too much content in a day, then a few days, then a week, a few weeks. all that time that i could've spent on meditating or producing. i realised creating does not make me as sleepy as consuming does. however, creating with a lot of difficulty does. when my skills are completely not up for the task, i find myself trying to avoid it. is this what is happening? i have so many ideas that are good for humanity, in my personal opinion of course, but i haven't completed any. i must try to learn more even if my skills can't produce or even if the results are non-existent or poor. i'm experimenting anyway.</p>
            <p>i find myself lacking of energy by noon-ish since mid october which doesn't make sense considering everything i do didn't change and the hours i spent in front of the computer was longer and improving prior to the sudden drop of energy.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>what am i doing</h2>
            <p>still trying to find a way to monetise anti-network. i want a business model that is profitable in the short and long term. i'm still finding my why, internally. i should write about it just to put my thoughts onto paper and inspect it before my upcoming meeting with a potential partner. </p>
            <p>i guess cli-mate.help has the highest potential as a for-profit or non-profit  business.</p>
            <p>i've recently started learning how to draw from proko's tutorials and my newly boughy ipad air on procreate. the human anatomy is awfully complicated and slightly interesting. what is more interesting is the way shades and light work. the simple combination of shades and lines could provide how certain objects are viewed in different light.</p>
