            <h1>hi there</h1>
            <p>i write here when i can and want. i also conduct research here sometimes, which can be filled with cancellations and mistakes. i'm experimenting and exploring life through my writings.</p>
            <p>i write shit-ly and wisely. it all depends on the reader.</p>
            <p>if you dislike my writings, don't let me know. if you disagree with my thoughts, email me your perspective at kingston.kdk@gmail.com i'll be happy to exchange and explore yours. the world can only be shared if people could agree on having different views. </p>
            <p>if you like my writings or agree with my thoughts, feel free to let me know in person if you get the unfortunate chance to be in the same space as me haha.</p>

            <h2>myself these days...</h2>    
            <p>i create, i build, i write, i consume, i think, and i do it all over again; not in any particular order. i want to expose myself to more long forms of mediums these days. i hear it's the healthier way of consuming materials online. and my brain agrees so far. as such, i have created this website, learning other skills to design websites that resonates with myself, and temporarily removed myself from social media. well, not all social media. i still have instagram. mostly to promote my brother's watch business until it's ready for production. and eventually use instagram again for cli-mate.help in outreach efforts once i've built the website with the skills that i'm learning now.</p>
            <p>today is 2nd sep 2025. for the next 30 to 60 days, i'll expect a full recovery. then, i'll start socialising physically and be more active. for now, i'll socialise as much as i can aka weekly or biweekly basis. and spend the rest of my time doing what i enjoy: consuming comedy; consuming and learning about philosophy; learning 3d website skills; learning about love; learning about artificial intelligence workflows; learning about hardware, well eventually; learning about nuclear; learning about privacy; writing about topics that pop up in my broken brain. idk much but anything yet so i'm simply exploring.</p>
            <p>i've read multiple articles and listened to friends about personal branding and they aka my friends said that what i'm doing now is on brand. i'm not a fan of subjecting my existence to a brand. a brand has to be one thing and not the other. a person can be both. contradictory is a possibility for humans and i prefer myself to be that way. to be able hold opposing ideas is a joy in itself. the arguments in my head make and do not make sense to me. it's the contradiction that i find comedic. life is simple. live easy. accept all and simply breathe while i exist. well not exactly all, murders are out of question. but you get the point, right? if you don't, who cares?</p>
