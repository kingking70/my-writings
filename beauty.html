            <p>my pursuit of beauty & love</p>
            <h3>beauty</h3>
            <p>beauty is what i want from the final product of my works. it is a deeply personal belief for each of my works. this website and the other websites i've created are not beautiful yet. i am ill-equipped to create beautiful works yet. from this moment forth, i shall pursue the skills to create beauty.</p>

            <h3>love</h3>
            <p>love is someone that i, if i'm fortunate enough, choose to elevate my life. it should be easy to and for the both of us. i don't see a reason why it should be a struggle. and i don't wish to compromise my life for other forms of disguised love. disguised love is difficult to spot and deadly. the characteristic of difficulty is because it can come in different pleasures: intellectual exchanges, frequent pride moments, or simply continued lust. i'll get into each pleasure in the following passages after i speak about the love i truly seek. i say that disguised love is deadly in its literally sense. choosing the wrong person to fall in love with is slow suicide. i'll elaborate in a further passage.</p>
            <p>i see love as a power. a power that is only achievable through luck. a power that is greater than individuals of two in a team. a synergy of which one cannot taste until one has experienced. and yet here i am, talking as if i have tasted it when i have yet to experience it. how do i know? i know as i know some flowers are poisonous. i know from stories, i need not experience it for myself to know. well, claiming that i know is a stretch. perhaps 'convinced' is the better term. thus, i am convinced that my partner must be someone i admire to begin love. someone of great strength. i don't mean in physicality but in intellect and beauty. although i am aware that my version of love is vastly different from most, idk how to convince other people otherwise. the common people are obsessed with rankings within a couple's dynamic or obsessed with corporate rankings. alpha, beta, being number 1, and number 2 do not make any sense to me. perhaps it makes more sense for the common people who like to pigeonhole concepts to simplify for themselves in their minds. perhaps i'd understand them one day, just kidding, i do not wish to comprehend any lesser minds. my version of love is far too complicated a topic to pigeonhole.</p>
            <p>have you spoken to someone and had intellectual exchanges? not just any thought provoking conversation, but awe inducing ideas that spark your mind, then its light lingered long enough to reach your heart to grow its fire. after which, the fire burns so heartily that it dries you up, and you thirst for another conversation with that special someone. </p>
