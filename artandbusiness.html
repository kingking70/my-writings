            <p>in this article, i argue that art and business need to be balanced in favour of business in order for a private art business to function healthily in singapore (sg). i use art as an encompassing term to cover culture, performance, galleries, and so on.</p>

            <p>as much as tertiary schools like to portray businesses as a science or recipe to be copied and applied, the truth is every business is anecdotal. the successes and failures can only be viewed within that specific context. i'm not saying that it's not possible to copy a business model and be successful. i'm saying that copying any business model as a recipe, down to each step, will gain you less failures &#8212 learning lessons &#8212 and success than the original model. </p>
            <p>this is the same for art. every art piece is unique in its way the artist express his or her interpretation about something. </p>
