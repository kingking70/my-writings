            <h2>how am i doing</h2>
            <p>symptoms still linger a little. overall, nearly fully recovered when i'm not tired. still have to train up my endurance for any activity that takes more than 2 hours.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>what am i doing</h2>
            <p>primarily exploring philosophy. toward practical thoughts for reality, mainly eastern and some western concepts. starting my research from francis pedraza and his spoken ideas. overall, i want to figure myself out and would problably take the whole year of 2026 to lay a solid foundation.</p>
            <p>secondarily starting businesses, saas and writing with a minimalist entrepreneur approach, inspired by sahil lavingia.</p>
            <p>while resting, i try to experience my emotions more deeply and laugh as much as possible from social interactions or comedy and meditate when my milieu allows.</p>
