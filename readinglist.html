            <p>i read many books at a time, to satiate my ever broad curiosity and broken brain. i read slowly to enjoy the words used. i only read quickly when i either need certain information for other uses or to return to those pages to savour them on another time. i read the books either on my kindle or physically. these days, i read most of the books physically because my kindle's shop can't load for some reason.</p>
