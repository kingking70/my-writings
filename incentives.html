            <p>i'm writing this article to investigate singapore's healthcare and energy systems' efficiency. don't get me wrong, i'm aware of its efficiency and hard work performed by individuals and institutions that support the system. i certainly do not have the formal credentials to criticise any part of these systems. i'm just studying its operations and workflows of various angles for the benefit of myself, a singaporean citizen.</p>
            <p>i'll try to approach this topic from an impersonal incentive perspective.</p>
