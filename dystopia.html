            <h1>dystopian life</h1>
            <p>i understand the confusion with the <a href="./utopia.html">utopia</a> article, the following words: life and technology seem to be mistakenly swapped. they weren't.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>life</h2>
            <p>my take is that my present is as dystopian as it can be given the miraculous innovations and progresses that most fields have made. despite the advancement in those fields, the people who benefit the least are the people without any access to those growth. simply put, dystopia is utopia without physical access to reality and bountiful of imaginery wealth and health.</p>
            <p>to me, </p>

            <h2>technology</h2>
