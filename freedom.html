            <h1>freedom</h1>
            <p>this page acts as my record of pursuits. it's titled freedom because i have no clue what else to name it.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>background</h2>
            <p>i write to record my actions and thoughts for my perusal.</p>

            <br/>
            <h2>good life</h2>
            <p>a good life to me is living freely with an abundant of resources at my disposal. i'm not a monk or a saint. i require necessities and desire physical possessions. i don't plan my future anymore in the long term. i don't even plan tomorrow for i finally come to terms that life is like nature. i simply idealise what it means to live a good life and live accordingly. the actual practice cannot be intellectualised or mentally formulated; using the word, 'practice' is not even accurate as words cannot describe it. only actions can convey what i meant to "say" per se.</p> 
            <p>unexpected things happen alike rain or ail. a downpour isn't bad for the world but a necessary response from climate changes, alike an illness is a compulsory bodily reaction for whatever we've done to our bodies. sometime along history, weather forecasts were made for us humans to plan our activities better. as with life, we could also decrease and/or increase the probabilities for certain events with certain actions. it is possible to place ourselves in specific surroundings intentionally and increase our probability to converge ourselves into someone or something that we desire. and perhaps remove ourselves from certain events and locations to prevent certain selves within us to have the possibility to birth and arise.</p>
            <p>the creation of a business seems to be the best medium to gain the accesses i require to play the games that would further my cause. with profitabiltiy and plausible longevity, this economic vehicle of mine could provide me with higher status in the games of wealth creation and status. idk if it's a bad thing, because i don't like it but it will definitely help me to obtain resources that i haven't thought of before.</p>
