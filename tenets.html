            <h2>me</h2>
            <p>i thought i start of by introducing myself and the opportunity that has enabled to think the way i think and do what i do.</p>
            <p>i'm kingston. i don't have much to identify myself with unlike other people and i hope this part of me remains even through weakness or strength, penury or abundance and everything in between.</p>
            <p>the opportunity is my illness, central neurocytoma, a benign brain tumour. i want to use the past tense, 'was' but the tumour still lives in my brain. i wrote about it briefly <a href="./absence.html">here</a>. i'll expand a little on my thought process now so you, the reader, could get a better understanding of the following passages.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>think</h2>
            <p>i had a scare from the public health surgeons because they painted a grim picture. i thought i was going to die. initially, i had a sense of regret regarding death because i've never truly experienced love but there's for a chat with a lady next time. besides that, i was fully accepting to die despite not contributing much to society. eventually, i went with a private surgeon and now, nearly full recovery during the hours when i'm not tired. however, recovery after a brain surgery and radiosurgery is not easy for some people and i fall under that category. i started thinking about my life more deeply and started to see my life, getting healthier, through a different lens. i started wanting to contributing to society within my means.</p>
            <p>the first thought, like many first thoughts, was intelligible and messy. after a few &#8212 more like many &#8212 tweaks and iterations, i finally decided to embark on a creator's journey. Creating the world i want instead of the world that was given to me. it may sound egoistical and grand but all i wanted to do was change the things, that we have been told that was socially expedient yet acceptable, within my milieu. i wanted more personal agency in my life. in layman terms, i sought to be an entrepreneur and/or other jobs that you think has more personal agency. i think that being a successful entrepreneur gives myself access to rooms and ideas i would have never visited. </p>
            <p>but not just any entrepreneur, i want to earn money while preserving my values. holding onto truths instead of participating in convenient deals. the idea is much simpler than what other people perceive. it is a cliche idea. an act to preserve the past, live in the present, and build the future. i guess most people would define my aspirations alike a socialpreneur but i don't want to be pigeon-holed as such. mainly because i, myself, don't know why i'm doing this. i don't have any preferences regarding trees and climate that much.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>do</h2>
            <p>i've created the following websites: <a href="https://anti-network.com" target="_blank">anti-network</a>, <a href="https://cli-mate.help" target="_blank">cli-mate.help</a>, and a part of cli-mate.help, <a href="https://newclear.website" target="_blank">newclear</a> and perhaps more in the future. the websites mainly address 2 of the 3 concepts which are living in the present and building the future. for the concept of preserving the past, i simply read and write. every activity is a pastime. some activities can also be work if one is compensated with resources he or she desires. perhaps the day i monetise my writings would be the day the last concept will be fulfilled. </p>
            <p>i don't have a strategy in place for my websites to increase traffic or gain $ka-ching$ aka profit besides diving deeper into its current principles within each website. this means i get to be weirder and more me. along the way, i desire to find my truth and someone would find theirs and/or learn something from my websites/content.</p>
