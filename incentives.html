            <p>i'm writing this article to investigate singapore's healthcare and energy systems' efficiency. don't get me wrong, i'm aware of its efficiency and hard work performed by individuals and institutions that support the system. i certainly do not have the formal credentials to criticise any part of these systems. i'm just studying its operations and workflows of various angles for the benefit of myself, a singaporean citizen.</p>
            <p>i'll try to approach this topic from an impersonal incentive perspective.</p>
            <p>actions and intentions can differ...</p>

            <p>to rewrite the following 2 passages because they appear in another article, tenets.</p>
            <p>the truth is everyone needs money to survive and reality complicates it. i'm unsure yet if we are self-sabotaging or for efficiency's sake but making money is frowned upon. economies are simply transactions over transactions. transactions are simply an exchange of goods and/or services with money. reality is alike a raw onion. tasting it aka making money is rather not well liked. it's also a rather complex resource game, layered with economies, transactions, money, and many other different layers of resources. to name a few of the most difficult layers of the game is health, poverty, access, persuasion, and emotions. these layers can be further categorised into stages, processes, both etc.
            <p>the truth is each layer is simple and usually the actors and considerations complicate it, for good or for bad i wouldn't be able to understand everything. this is what makes life dynamic and fun. the uncertainty and certainty of peoples' choices and decisions. the artistic and awful application throughout peoples' actions. these are what i savour and enjoy and you should too. life is terribly complex and dreadfully simple. making money is just part of the game we call life and having more resources is always better than less &#8212 considering the ethical implications of making money within the scope of your neighbour, his/her life improves &#8212 so earn more money, make more profits.</p>
