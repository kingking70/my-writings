            <p>creativity, as we know of it, did not emerge for the purposes we now know of. initially, creativity was used to transmit behaviour to communicate. knowledge cannot be assumed to progress. its process is fallible because we are simply general purpose explanation machines.</p>
            <p>the idea of agi has much further deeper and broader consequences than the brightest minds think. deutsch speaks of the difference in context and direction of which agi is going compared to ai itself. should agi come true, it would mean another species of its own. its intelligence will then be its own. everything, from ownership, rights, property, social status will be questioned in its respective milieu. should agi be a slave for human, that would desecrate the very values that build toward agi and espouse unethical considerations. from deutsch, 'the law of comparative advantage says that the more different you are from other people, the more valuable you are economically'. this suggest an exact clone will just diminish your value. 'everybody is unfathomably different from everyone else. that fact is not being harnessed enough and can be harnessed more'. i would add that it 'should be' harnessed more, instead of 'can be'.</p>
            <p>ai by itself is useful.</p>
            <p>a theory to explain general intelligence. to build artificial general intelligence.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>to look into creating a theory to explain general intelligence.</p>
