            <h2>me</h2>
            <p>i thought i start of by introducing myself and the opportunity that has enabled to think the way i think and do what i do.</p>
            <p>i'm kingston. i don't have much to identify myself with unlike other people and i hope this part of me remains even through weakness or strength, penury or abundance and everything in between.</p>
            <p>the opportunity is my illness, central neurocytoma, a benign brain tumour. i want to use the past tense, 'was' but the tumour still lives in my brain. i wrote about it briefly <a href="./absence.html">here</a>. i'll expand a little on my thought process now so you, the reader, could get a better understanding of the following passages.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>think</h2>
            <p>i had a scare from the public health surgeons because they painted a grim picture. i thought i was going to die. i had only one regret: it was not loving someone or something wholeheartedly. besides that, i was fully accepting to die. eventually, i went with a private surgeon. now, i've reached almost full recovery during the hours when i'm not tired. however, recovery after a brain surgery and radiosurgery is not easy for some people and i fall under that category. i started thinking about my life more deeply and started to see my life, as i regain my intelligence and health, through a different lens. i started wanting to contributing to society within my measly means.</p>
            <p>the first thought, like many first thoughts, was unintelligible and messy. after a few &#8212 more like many &#8212 tweaks and iterations, i finally decided to embark on a creator's journey. Creating the world i want instead of the world that was given to me. it may sound egoistical and grand but all i wanted to do was change the things, that we have been told that was socially expedient yet acceptable, within my milieu. i wanted more personal agency in my life. in layman terms, i sought to be an entrepreneur of sorts. i think that being a successful entrepreneur would provide myself access to rooms, ideas, and people i would never have the opportunity to visit. </p>
            <p>but not just any entrepreneur, i want to earn money while preserving my values. holding onto truths instead of participating in convenient deals. the idea is much simpler than what other people perceive. it is a cliche idea. to create something or things that preserve the past, live in the present, and build the future whilst sticking to the truth regardless of any social context across times. essentially, creating something that is timeless and apt for only truth. i guess most people would define my aspirations alike a socialpreneur but i don't want to be pigeon-holed as such. mainly because i, myself, don't know why i'm doing this. i don't have any preferences regarding trees and climate that much. </p>
            
            <br/>
            <h2>do</h2>
            <p>so far, to preserve the past, i've created this <a href="https://kingstonkoh.com" target="_blank">"blog"</a> like space where i can just write. perhaps i'll monetise through substack once i've built an audience. to live in the present, i've created <a href="https://cli-mate.help" target="_blank">cli-mate.help</a>, a place where people can find interactive games and storytelling articles regarding everything that is innovative regarding our home, earth; and a part of cli-mate.help, <a href="https://newclear.website" target="_blank">newclear</a> is for public education regarding nuclear energy. i believe singapore could be a lot more independent with our energy resources, the barriers i see currently are more on research and public consensus. the website plans to address the latter issue. and lastly, <a href="https://anti-network.com" target="_blank">anti-network</a> is to build a future with as many ethical and high personal agency people as possible.</p>
            <p>i don't have a strategy in place for my websites to increase traffic or gain $ka-ching$ aka profit besides diving deeper into its current principles within each website. this means i get to be weirder and more me. along the way, i desire to find the truth and hope someone learns something from my websites or content.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>in all</h2>
            <p>perhaps i'll regret if i die now because i've finally found something i love to do which is creating and telling stories. i can't believe i'm getting paid to do this. this is fun for me. that said, i'm not going to not monetise my content and give it all up for free. i believe i'll create something that is of value to people and i deserve to be paid my fair share. for now, i'll just continue creating until my health fails me again.</p>
            <p>thank you for reading.</p>
