            <p>my pursuit of beauty & love</p>
            <h3>beauty</h3>
            <p>beauty is what i want from the final product of my works. it is a deeply personal belief for each of my works. this website and the other websites i've created are not beautiful yet. i am ill-equipped to create beautiful works yet. from this moment forth, i shall pursue the skills to create beauty.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>love</h3>
            <p>love is someone that i, if i'm fortunate enough, choose to elevate my life. it should be easy to and for the both of us. i don't see a reason why it should be a struggle. and i don't wish to compromise my life for other forms of disguised love. disguised love is difficult to spot and deadly. the characteristic of difficulty is because it can come in different pleasures: intellectual exchanges, frequent pride moments, or simply continued lust. i'll get into each pleasure in the next passages. i say that disguised love is deadly in its literally sense. choosing the wrong person to fall in love with is slow suicide. i'll elaborate in a further passage.</p>
            <p>have you spoken to someone and had intellectual exchanges? not just any thought provoking conversation, but awe inducing ideas that spark your mind, then its light lingered long enough to reach your heart to grow its fire. after which, the fire burns so heartily that it dries you up, and you thirst for another conversation with that special someone. </p>
