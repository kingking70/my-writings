            <p>i was diagnosed with central neurocytoma in oct 2024. a darn rare benign brain tumour that has affected hundreds of people globally and historically. there's 8.2 billion people globally now, so idk if i won a lottery ticket or something else. most would say the latter, but i'm slightly convinced it's the former.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>i'm not going to lie, the experience was painful and literally distorting. in the beginning for the first 5-6 months, my stability was problematic for myself and an inconvenience to others. these days, my stability has improved and only occasionally will i experience disequilibrium. it's like being on a yacht daily. what a luxurious experience, wouldn't you think? but the discomfort has taught me many things. i won't get into the details with all i learnt and experienced but i'll just brush on some that i think you'd need to know if you're meeting me in person.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>i had dinner last mid july in the evening, as all dinners should be, with some dear friends. i was medically recommended to socialise more often to get used to the environment and its stimuli. we ate at a relatively crowded place and i was alright. i stuck around for about 2 hours and my friends sent me home. i thought i had a great night and was tired from that short - but long for me - engagement, so i fell well asleep. the following day, i woke up with an influx of ideas running through my head. i later found out that i was overstimulated and due to the blood supply, it's normal to experience overwhelming sensations.</p>

            <p>the picture is a part of the physical manifestation of my brain now. but imagine more floors, not just upwards like a regular building, but in different directions, filled with the same amount of materials and more. most books and pages are scribbled, indiscernible; some are blank; the rest are at least logical. but the logical ones are spread around at different floors, at different directions. which makes it difficult for me to collate them all and organise them into a sentence. to speak. to communicate. sometimes, i lack the energy to speak. sometimes, i lack the speed to catch up with my thoughts, leaving me gasping for air; literally breathless. i'm seeing a speech therapist in 4th sep 2025 so i hope that would help me. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>these days, because i need an outlet to relieve the thoughts in my head, i've started to direct ideas into starting websites and writing. on days that my thoughts get too messy, i simply meditate. i find meditation helpful in those situations to calm myself for at least 10-15mins after. just enough time to tidy my ideas and focus on my to-do list. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>i still get drowsy in the day due to my medications, disequilibrium when i walk sometimes, speech impairments, and the occasional muscle twitches. i like to tell people that i have a broken brain now so it's easier for me to get away in all situations. other than that, i live as you do. i can't exactly be productive when i choose to so i'm living my life without any plans for myself. i find living with a life goal a bit useless for me due to any unforeseen and inevitable circumstances like my current illness. i prefer living with constraints now, it's easier for me. don't do this, don't do that, avoid this, avoid that. the list is shorter than one would think; and it opens up more opportunities than one would assume. i recommend this way of living for those healthy. it's simply avoiding the bad habits and just live. very liberating. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>i wrote this not to get pitied and be felt sorry for so don't send me messages. i just wanted to give an update to those affected or cared. and provide an explanation to people who i'm meeting but too lazy to reiterate it. i don't want to be identified with this, but i guess most people will do. my situation isn't any of your business to be honest, unless you're physically affected by it, i don't see why and how i need to make any amends with you. so don't pity, feel sorry, or worry for me. although the situation is tough, i'm tougher aplenty. </p>
