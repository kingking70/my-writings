            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>i create, i build, i write, i consume, i think, and i do it all over again; not in any particular order. i want to expose myself to more long forms of mediums these days. i hear it's the healthier way of consuming materials online. and my brain agrees so far. as such, i have created this website, learning other skills to design websites that resonates with myself, and temporarily removed myself from social media. well, not all social media. i still have instagram. mostly to promote my brother's watch business until it's ready for production. and eventually use instagram again for cli-mate.help in outreach efforts once i've built the website with the skills that i'm learning now.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>for the next 30 to 60 days, i'll expect a full recovery. then, i'll start socialising physically and be more active. for now, i'll socialise as much as i can aka weekly or biweekly basis. and spend the rest of my time doing what i enjoy: consuming comedy; consuming and learning about philosophy; learning 3d website skills; learning about love; learning about artificial intelligence workflows; learning about hardware, well eventually; learning about nuclear; learning about privacy; writing about topics that pop up in my broken brain. idk much but anything yet so i'm simply exploring.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>i've read multiple articles and listened to friends about personal branding and they aka my friends said that what i'm doing now is on brand. i'm not a fan of subjecting my existence to a brand. a brand has to be one thing and not the other. a person can be both. contradictory is a possibility for humans and i prefer myself to be that way. to be able hold opposing ideas is a joy in itself. the arguments in my head make and do not make sense to me. it's the contradiction that i find comedic. life is simple. live easy. accept all and simply breathe while i exist. well not exactly all, murders are out of question. but you get the point, right? if you don't, who cares?</p>
