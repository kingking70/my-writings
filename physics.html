            <h2>motion</h2>
            <p>time, position, velocity, and acceleration.</p>
            <p>kinematic equations. the expression that connects classical motion, as opposed to quantum motion.</p>
            <p>velocity is the way your position changes over time. in the case of a 2 dimension example, say driving a car in a straight line. velocity is metres over seconds. acceleration is the change of velocity, which means the change of the change over time. thus, acceleration is measured in the change of metres per second aka metres over second times a fraction of a second aka metres per second squared.</p> 
            <p>velocity is the change in position over time while acceleration is the change of velocity over time. change is mathematically calculated by subtracting its value from its final value. in physics, change is denoted by delta of greek's, a triangle symbol, Δ.</p>
            <p>the equation for the definition of acceleration, assuming acceleration takes place at a constant rate, ˉv = v_0 + at. ˉv is the average velocity. v_0 is the initial velocity. at is the product of acceleration and time, the multiplication of a and t.</p>
            <p>the displacement curve equation, to consider position, is x - x_0 = v_0t + 1/2at^2. x is the position. x_0 is the initial position. v_0t is the product of the initial velocity and time. 1/2at^2 is half the product of the acceleration and time squared. </p>
            <p>in the case of driving a car in a straight line and finding out if i deserve a ticket for speeding, simply plug in the numbers into the displacement curve equation and subsequently, into the definition of acceleration. the calculated amount should determine if i deserve a ticket for speeding or not.</p>
