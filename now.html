            <h2>how am i doing</h2>
            <p>symptoms still linger a little. overall, nearly fully recovered when i'm not exhausted. my neck has shrunk so much that it looks like a twig from behind. i'd need to slowly gain strength and size for my neck whilst improving my stability. my speech is not yet my desired state but it's getting better.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>what am i doing</h2>
            <p>creating and learning on a need to basis. improving my writings for my blog and nuclear energy themed <a href="https://newclear.website" target="_blank">website</a> for public education, experimenting blender skills to sculpt a venus head to replace the moon that is orbiting on my personal <a href="https://kkohs.com" target="_blank">website</a>, understanding basic hardware, exploring chinese antiques, attempting to learn the related drawing and painting skills for my surrealism art piece.</p>
            <p>these days, i've never been more interested in myself than ever before. that statement did not come from egotistic or narcissistic intentions but born from curiosity. my motives come from a place of sincerity. most people simply don't interest me enough.</p>
            <p>in 2026, i'd most probably be building my creations more formally once i'm all recovered.</p>
