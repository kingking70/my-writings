            <h1>kingston koh</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>i write here when i can and want. i also conduct research here sometimes, which can be filled with mistakes. i'm experimenting and exploring life through my writings.</p>
            <p>i write shit-ly and wisely. it all depends on the reader, you.</p>
            <p>if you dislike my writings, don't let me know. if you disagree with my thoughts, email me your perspective at kingston.kdk@gmail.com; i'll be more than happy to explore yours. the world can only be shared if people could disagree and agree on having different views. </p>
            <p>if you like my writings or agree with my thoughts, feel free to let me know in person if you get the unfortunate chance to be in the same space as me haha.</p>
